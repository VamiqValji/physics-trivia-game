# Physics Trivia Game

**THIS PROJECT WAS MADE IN EARLY NOVEMBER, BEFORE EVEN STARTING MY GAME OFF 2020 SUBMISSION.**

**I mention that everything in the program is made by me. I meant everything that was USED, excluding text fonts. Thank you for understanding.**

THIS PROJECT NEEDS PYGAME ZERO IN ORDER TO RUN.

The music was used from old files when getting to understand a music software. Not my proudest work at all, haha

The font that I imported (that wasn't already in the PyGame Zero folder by default) was Poppins, and can be found for free here:
