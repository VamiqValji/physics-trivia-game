# final-project-MrGit1

**I mention that everything in the program is made by me. I meant everything that was USED, excluding text fonts. Thank you for understanding.**

THIS PROJECT NEEDS PYGAME ZERO IN ORDER TO RUN.

Ignore any files that say you should ignore them. Ignore the scrapped projects folder as well.
Most **USED** assets in the program were created by Vamiq Valji;
including the music and the images.

I may have not been extremely clear, **though the text fonts WERE NOT CREATED BY ME. ALL CREDITS FOR TEXT FONTS GO TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS.**

The font that I imported (that wasn't already in the PyGame Zero folder by default) was Poppins, and can be found for free here:
